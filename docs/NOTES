* Setting up on huban with nginx + letsencrypt
    * www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04
    * nginx conf is at /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    * to restart nginx: sudo service nginx restart
    * OK, nginx is running but we can't even hit :80. What gives?
    * I had to uninstall and reinstall because shit wasn't working
        * Couldn't hit port 80 and get the default message :(
    * I had ufw firewall installed. Commands to get 80 and 443 enabled:
        * sudo ufw allow http
        * sudo ufw allow https
    * add /.well-known to nginx config:

        location ~ /.well-known {
            allow all;
        }

    * restart nginx
    * get the cert:
        certbot-auto certonly -a webroot --webroot-path=/srv/hubvan.com -d hubvan.com -d www.hubvan.com
    * failed because www.hubvan.com is not available.
        * had to add a cname for www.
        * had to clear the DNS cache locally to be able to hit it:

            sudo dscacheutil -flushcache;sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

        * https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean
    * next, the config failed to reload; the nginx master process crashed but the workers were still running
        * I killed those and got hubvan to load. Now to retry cerbot!
    * success! domain verified and certs generated
